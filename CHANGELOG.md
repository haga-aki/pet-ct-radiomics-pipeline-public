# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added generic guarded smooth SI adaptation with discrete fitting-patch scale
  acceptance and exact saved-mask prediction checks; no study paths or runtime
  monkeypatching are required.
- Added mandatory complete 117-label inventory and original/saved overlap gates
  to cached-input and DICOM opt-in adaptation routes. Failed candidates are not
  moved to accepted output paths. Original input hashes must remain unchanged.
- Added a lightweight GitHub Actions matrix for Python 3.10–3.12 that runs
  synthetic-data unit tests and syntax checks without accessing study data.

### Fixed
- Prevented case-specific SUV inflation by avoiding a second application of
  DICOM Rescale Slope and Intercept to PET NIfTI values already rescaled by
  `dicom2nifti`.
- Added regression tests covering raw DICOM pixels and modality-rescaled BQML
  NIfTI values.
- Removed the unsupported `enableCExtensions` key from `params.yaml`, which
  prevented parameter validation with current PyRadiomics releases.
- Existing PET SUV NIfTI outputs are now rebuilt on rerun so files created by
  the previous conversion logic are not silently reused.
- Added Apple MPS detection and routing for TotalSegmentator on supported Macs.
- Fusion QC generation now uses the active `--output` directories instead of
  falling back to paths beside the pipeline source code.
- Representative-slice de-duplication now backfills all six QC panels, and QC
  titles remain visible on the black figure background.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- Aligned the public pipeline with the JJR manuscript workflow:
  - PET is resampled to CT space before SUV conversion and PET radiomics extraction
  - `params.yaml` is applied during PET radiomics extraction
  - CT radiomics export is disabled by default
- Updated README and supporting documentation to match the released workflow and
  clarify that no additional PyRadiomics resampling is performed after PET-to-CT
  resampling.

### Fixed
- Removed broken references to non-existent visualization scripts from the
  public analysis entry points.
- Removed tracked derived CSV examples that were not appropriate for public
  distribution.
- Updated release metadata to match the manuscript-aligned public version.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **DICOM Series Auto-Selection**: Automatically detects and selects appropriate CT/PET series from multi-series DICOM data
  - Filters out Dose Reports, Localizers, MIP images, and other non-volumetric series
  - Configurable minimum slice counts (`min_ct_slices`, `min_pet_slices`)
  - Series selection based on SeriesDescription, slice count, and image dimensions
- **New visualization module** (`visualize_mask_verification.py`):
  - Mediastinal window CT settings (WL=40, WW=400)
  - PET-CT fusion with mask overlay
  - Axial + Coronal dual-view display
  - Automatic slice selection based on organ positions
- **Version report command**: `python run_pipeline.py --version-report`
- **Dry run mode**: `python run_pipeline.py --dry-run` for previewing without processing

### Changed
- **Updated default organ set**:
  - Liver, bilateral kidneys, bilateral adrenal glands, L1 vertebra, aorta, left lung (upper/lower lobes)
  - Optimized for clinical PET/CT analysis
- **Dependency version locking**:
  - PyTorch >= 2.4 (required for TotalSegmentator compatibility)
  - NumPy >= 1.26, < 2.0 (NumPy 2.x incompatible)
  - TotalSegmentator >= 2.0, < 3.0
  - PyRadiomics >= 3.0, < 4.0
- **Environment files updated** for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Fixed
- **PyTorch/TotalSegmentator compatibility**: Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'DiagnosticOptions' from 'torch.onnx._internal.exporter'`
- **NumPy version conflict**: Fixed `A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.x`
- **DICOM series structure recognition**: Fixed issue where multi-series folders were incorrectly processed as separate patients

### Technical Details

#### DICOM Auto-Selection Logic
When processing a folder with multiple DICOM series:
1. Scans all subfolders for DICOM files
2. Reads metadata from first file in each series (Modality, SeriesDescription, Rows, Columns)
3. Filters by minimum slice count (default: CT ≥ 100, PET ≥ 50)
4. For CT: Prioritizes 512x512 standard resolution
5. For PET: Prioritizes series with "Axial" or "Body" in description
6. Falls back to series with maximum slice count

#### Visualization Settings
- CT Window: Mediastinal (WL=40 HU, WW=400 HU)
- PET Color Map: Hot
- PET SUV Range: 0-10
- Mask Overlay Alpha: 0.3
